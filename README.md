# Next.js Docker Golden Path üöÄ

This is a boilerplate and a set of best practices for developing Next.js applications inside Docker, specifically tailored for macOS users. It is designed to be the definitive "Golden Path" that solves common, frustrating, and time-consuming issues related to cross-platform compatibility and container orchestration.

## The "Why": Core Problems This Boilerplate Solves

This configuration was born from a difficult debugging process and is engineered to permanently solve the following problems:

*   ‚úÖ **Binary Incompatibility (The Mac vs. Linux Problem):** Prevents errors like `Cannot find module '../lightningcss.linux-x64-musl.node'`. It achieves this by creating a dedicated Docker volume for `node_modules`, ensuring dependencies are installed and compiled for the container's Linux environment, not your local macOS.

*   ‚úÖ **File Mount Race Conditions:** Prevents errors like `No package.json was found in "/app"`. The custom `entrypoint.sh` script acts as a smart startup manager, forcing the container to wait until your local files are fully mounted before it attempts to install dependencies or start the server.

*   ‚úÖ **Environment Consistency:** Ensures that the development environment is 100% consistent and reproducible, regardless of your local machine's configuration. What works on your machine will work for any collaborator, and it will work in production.

*   ‚úÖ **Simplified Workflow:** Provides a simple, repeatable set of commands to start, stop, and interact with your application.

## üöÄ Quickstart: How to Use for a New Project

Follow these steps to go from zero to a running application in minutes. This workflow is designed to avoid any file conflicts during setup.

### Step 1. Clone This Boilerplate
Clone this repository into a new directory with your project's name. **Remember to use all lowercase letters and hyphens.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CFM2hack/nextjs-docker-boilerplate my-new-project-name
cd my-new-project-name
```

### Step2: Create the Next.js Project
Run the create-next-app installer in the current directory (.). This will populate the folder with the Next.js starter code. It will succeed because the initial .gitignore file does not ignore the Docker configuration.
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --eslint
```
(Answer "Yes" to Tailwind CSS and Turbopack when prompted.)

### Step 3: Finalize Git Configuration and Convert to PNPM
This crucial step prepares your project for development by swapping the `.gitignore` file, converting to the correct package manager, and creating your initial commit.

```bash
# First, replace the temporary boilerplate .gitignore with the final one
# This tells Git to ignore Docker files in YOUR application repository.
mv .gitignore.final .gitignore

# Next, remove the node_modules and package-lock.json created by the npm-based installer.
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Now, install all dependencies fresh using pnpm.
# This creates a pnpm-lock.yaml file and ensures your project is consistent with our Docker setup.
pnpm install

# Finally, create the very first commit for your new application's history.
# This stages all the new Next.js files and our configuration changes.
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Initial commit with Next.js and project setup
```

### Setp 4: Step 4: Make Entrypoint Executable
You only need to do this once per project clone. This gives the startup script permission to run.
```bash
chmod +x entrypoint.sh
```

### Step 5: Customize `docker-compose.yml` (Optional)
This is a highly recommended step for keeping your projects organized. Open docker-compose.yml and change the default container_name fields to match your new project name.

*From:*
```yaml
container_name: my-app-name
container_name: my-app-db
```
*To:*

```yaml
container_name: my-new-project-name_app
container_name: my-new-project-name_db
```

### Step 6: Build and Run!
Bring your entire development environment online with a single command.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
The first build will take a minute to install dependencies inside the container's volume. Subsequent builds will be much faster.
Your application will be running at http://localhost:3000.



## üí° Daily Development Workflow

### Starting the Server
From the project root, simply run:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Stopping the Server
Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the server is running. To ensure containers are fully stopped and removed, you can also run:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Running One-Off Commands
To run commands like database migrations, you need to execute them inside the running app container. Use the `docker-compose run --rm app` command.

Example: Running Prisma Migrate
```bash
docker-compose run --rm app pnpm prisma migrate dev
```

Example: Installing a new package (e.g., clsx)
```bash
# 1. Install the package inside the container
docker-compose run --rm app pnpm add clsx
# 2. Restart the server to use the new package
docker-compose up --build
```

### üîß Troubleshooting
`pnpm` or other weird errors: If things get strange, the most reliable fix is the `Hard Reset.`

```bash
# Stop all containers
docker-compose down

# Optional: Prune old volumes if you suspect data corruption
docker volume prune

# Rebuild everything from scratch
docker-compose up --build
```
If `Permission denied: ./entrypoint.sh`: You forgot to make the script executable. Run the command
```bash
chmod +x entrypoint.sh.
```
